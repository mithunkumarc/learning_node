###### node : node is not a framework, node is an run time env for js
      cross platfrom
      opensource
      run time environment for java script outside browser


      great for prototyping and agile development
      superfast and highly scalable
      javascript everywhere : fullstack

      architecture
      js code -> js engine(v8) -> execute

      history : browser was only rte for javascript
      after 2009 : ryan dahl : node (v8 embedded in c++) 


    node = v8(chrome uses as js engine) embedded in c++
